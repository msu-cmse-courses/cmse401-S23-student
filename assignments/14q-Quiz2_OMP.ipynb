    "The Mandelbrot set has become popular for its aesthetic appeal and as an example of a complex structure arising from the application of simple rules.  The study of these types of fractal patterns has helped theorists better understand chaotic systems. There is a close relationship is some scientific simulations which are \"sensitive\" to their inputs.  For example, even a very small changes in the inputs for a \"sensitive\" simulation results in very large changes in the output.  This was first discovered with early weather simulations and is often called the butterfly effect (i.e. the small change in wind velocity input parameter from, say, a butterfly flapping it's wings can cause a significant change in the situation). \n",
