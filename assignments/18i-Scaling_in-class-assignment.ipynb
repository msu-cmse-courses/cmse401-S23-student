    "> **STRONG SCALING** In this case the problem size stays fixed but the number of processing elements are increased. This is used as justification for programs that take a long time to run (something that is cpu-bound). The goal in this case is to find a \"sweet spot\" that allows the computation to complete in a reasonable amount of time, yet does not waste too many cycles due to parallel overhead. In strong scaling, a program is considered to scale linearly if the speedup (in terms of work units completed per unit time) is equal to the number of processing elements used ( N ). In general, it is harder to achieve good strong-scaling at larger process counts since the communication overhead for many/most algorithms increases in proportion to the number of processes used.\n",

Therefore, this type of measurement is justification for programs that take a lot of memory or other system resources (something that is memory-bound). In the case of weak scaling, linear scaling is achieved if the run time stays constant while the workload is increased in direct proportion to the number of processors. Most programs running in this mode should scale well to larger core counts as they typically employ nearest-neighbour communication patterns where the communication overhead is relatively constant regardless of the number of processes used; exceptions include algorithms that employ heavy use of global communication patterns, eg. FFTs and transposes.\n",
